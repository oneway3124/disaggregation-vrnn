But in my computer it executes this:

I was trying to install gpu but then realized that even the CUDA toolkit is installed, there's sth missing: 

When installing theano with conda, missing to install python2x. So just copy it from somewhere

Install pandas=0.19.2 Because that is the one with Period in module pd.TimeSeries (or later)
conda install pandas=0.19.2 (otherwise also problem with pd.tseries.period.PeriodIndex)
No module yaml, networkx, builtins:
pip install pyyaml
pip install networkx
pip install future #for builtins
pip install --upgrade IPython
pip install matplotlib
pip install tables # for  HDFStore requires PyTables

conda install scikit-learn
conda install -c anaconda mkl-service
conda install -c anaconda lxml


ValueError: cannot reindex a non-unique index with a method or limit
#data = data.drop(['2013-09-06 09:01:46.300000'])
data = data[~data.index.duplicated(keep='first')]
data = data.resample(...)
But it was weird because it was working normally with vrnn but when I run neuralnilm it gave me an error. Maybe it's something with one of the libraries on each conda environment.

When trying Kelly's for each appliance alone:
Kettle did not have any activations for unseen_activ from 2015-07-01, so I made it from 2014-07-01
